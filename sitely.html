    <h2>What is this website?</h2>
    <p class="answer">I originally started this website under the name 'Shineycats'. I used the Sadgirl layout generator at first, and hosted the site on neocities. I was really fascinated by the world of the indie web I had found, and I wanted a slice of my own! I really wish I could recall what the first site I had come across was; I wish I could remember. Not long after I began to work on the site, I found the name I had to be "inadequate" for what I was trying to achieve, and settled on Alys Realm. I <b>love</b> the fae and the idea of an "otherworldly third place" that captures the-worst-of-the-worst and the-best-of-the-best.</p> 
    <h2>Site Accessibility</h2>
    <p class="answer">Accessibility is important to me -<i>seeing as I am disabled myself</i>- <strong>BUT!</strong>, seeing as this site started as a creative outlet for me, that will continue to be the primary focus for me. <em>At the least</em><a href="https://pinkvampyr.bearblog.dev/web-revival-accessibility/" target="_blank"> x </a>,I have tried to make sure that things will go as smoothly for screen-readers as possible, and also that my site will operate on mobile; <i>at least for the more information heavy sites</i>. This is also my first ever foray into HTML/CSS, so please be patient!</p>


    <h2>How was this site made?</h2>
    <p class="answer"><i>This site has gone through many 'phases' relating to my methods for creating it.</i> But currently, I am using Visual Studio Code, and I probably will stay with it forever considering the ease I have found with it ^0^. I use the <a href="https://neocities.org/cli">Neocities Command Line Interface (CLI)</a> directly inside VSC, to update my site from the directory file on my PC straight to the host on Neocities!</p>
