          <b>10/3/2024-</b> Hello! It's been a while since I updated. I am proud of where my site is currently at; even though it is definitely half baked!!! I wanted to push this update in lieu of perfectionisim, since I can only see the idea of publishing it getting more daunting as time goes on. Lol <b>I added a blog (via Zoner)! And scrapped the landing page</b><s>As well as some other unfinished and broken links</s>

          <b>8/12/2024-</b> Attempted to touch up the 'paint' of my homepage,
          definitely subject to change! I made my landing page less complex!
          Added a new 404 page, a button wall, and
          <b>my two favorites, my about me and my links!</b> I am also trying to
          get better at documenting changes!
        </p>

          <b>07/28/2024-</b> I added a landing page then I FINALLY figured out
          my homepage's first official version! I think I've said that a few
          times already, but I mean it this time. It's responsive now! There's
          still a lot more that needs reworked, but now I feel as if I have the
          base I needed to grow the site out! small update 7/29: added the start
          of my button wall!
