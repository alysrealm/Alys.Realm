      <h1>Site Update Log</h1>
      <p><b>12/13/2024</b> Added a <a href="/shrines/splash.html">splash</a> for my shrines, as well as the 1st version of my <a href="/shrines/unicornos.html">Unicorno</a> shrine</p>
      <p><b>11/29/2024</b> Made updates page fancy üê∏, fixed up the <a href="/index.html">collections</a> page</p>
      <p><b>11/19/2024</b> It's been a while! I have done a few slight updates in the past month or so, but never added anything to this updates section. This update is solely just a cosmetic change, but I wanted to add to this updates wall, and also I'm p proud of the main look I have going on. Blog post coming soon, I hope?</p>
    
      <p><b>10/15/2024</b> Added my <a href="/sitely.html">Site information</a> page! More to come for that page as well!</p>
        <p><b>10/8/2024</b> Fixed up some broken links, added the shrine for my cat <a href="/cats/leocat.html">Leo!</a></p>
        <p>
          <b>10/3/2024-</b> Hello! It's been a while since I updated. I am proud of where my site is currently at; even though it is definitely half baked!!! I wanted to push this update in lieu of perfectionisim, since I can only see the idea of publishing it getting more daunting as time goes on. Lol <b>I added a blog (via Zoner)! And scrapped the landing page</b><s>As well as some other unfinished and broken links</s> 
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>8/12/2024-</b> Attempted to touch up the 'paint' of my homepage,
          definitely subject to change! I made my landing page less complex!
          Added a new 404 page, a button wall, and
          <b>my two favorites, my about me and my links!</b> I am also trying to
          get better at documenting changes!
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>07/28/2024-</b> I added a landing page then I FINALLY figured out
          my homepage's first official version! I think I've said that a few
          times already, but I mean it this time. It's responsive now! There's
          still a lot more that needs reworked, but now I feel as if I have the
          base I needed to grow the site out! small update 7/29: added the start
          of my button wall!
        </p>
