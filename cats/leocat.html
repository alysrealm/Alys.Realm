                <p><span class="beginning">The day we got Leo was July 31, 2018.</span> I remember that day because my mom left work to take my my sister to a therapy appointment, so my grandma met her at a halfway point to drop her off. I went along for the ride, and begged my mom to take me to the SPCA, even just to look. I had been wanting a cat for a while at this point, so I was already using the money I earned from my job to buy cat things before hand. She yelled at me, saying we would only be in there for like 15 minutes, and reluctantly agreed to take me to go "look" at cats after the appointment. I waited an hour in the car, watching South Park and using wet wipes to clean out my moms crusty cupholders. Then me, my mom, and sister were off to the shelter! We were in there a lot longer than 15 minutes. The cats are always so silly! We walked around the room before we saw Leo <i>(then Dante)</i>, and his brother (which was black&#45;which is some very strange cat genetics) I can't recall why, but we were all instantly drawn to him. He was a sweet kitten. We signed the papers and brought him home that day! I remember he rode on my lap because we didn't have a carrier. He was so teensy when we brought him home! The day was then spent doting over this new creamsicle colored kitty we had brought home. Our big goofy dog (later they would become best pals) scared him! After some thought, I decided his name would be Leo. "Oh, like the zodiac because you got him in August? Or like Leo the lion..?" is what the ladies at the vet asked me. They looked a little funny when I told them he was Leonardo Dicatrio. Because I was a highschool sophomore and Leo in Romeo and Juliet really activated my teenage thirstiness. And I also thought it was funny to give your cats goofy names which can be shortened into something normal sounding.</p>

                <p>Leo grew fast! He was a mischevious little kitty, but lovable all the same. Everyone that met him loved him! Even my friends(at the time) who didn't like cats. My mom even said that if she would have known he would have been such a good cat, that she would have brought home his brother. He was a lover to everyone, but especially to me.</p>
                <p>When I got sick toward the end of october- at least for the short period when I was still at home- he would lay on me, and keep me company in my weary state. I would lay on the couch and crochet, while he laid on my legs and the dog laid on the other arm of the sectional. When I left, I had no idea if I would ever see those two again. It made me so sad to think about it. My grandma house sat with my siblings while mom was with me in the hospital, so she would send me lots of pictures of my boys. Around the Christmas season then I did get a pet camera; it was the kind that shot treats. With that I was able to interact with them again! Even though they were both a little confused by it LOL. I would tell everyone about my babies back home. I kept pictures of them in my room too! In the summer of August 2021 I was able to come back home and see my family after 10 months away. Sparky (the dog), was happy nonetheless to see me! Leo however was slightly put off by my wheelchair, but he didn't take very long to get used to it</p>
            
                <hr>
    
                <p>Now after these years Leo has really bonded to me! If he isn't sleeping in one of his peculiar spots or eating, he's usually right by my side. He never meowed much when he was a kitten, but today he meows often- well at least for me. Now we have full on meow conversations. He does also meow at other people for attention or food. He reallly loves food; even if it's just to smell it. Maybe that fact is obvious, considering he's a large cat (also an orange one). He is 6 now, so he prefers to eat and chill rather than cause mayhem (at least 80% of the time). I let him come outside with me when I go out to sit since he really just likes to hang out in the fresh air on our deck.</p>
