        <p>Hey you! Welcome to my little corner of the web! Very happy to have you here! I call myself Alysson here/other places online, but that's just my middle name hehe. I go by <b>Alys + Syla</b> too. I chose to go by that since it gives me a nice degree of separation from real life (fear not! if you know my real name it's okay haha). I'm currently 21 years old&mdash; I'm a February Aquarius baby!! 
        I don't wanna beat around the bush since it's (unfortunately) an important part of what shaped my current day self; I'm a survivor of a rare stg. 4 sarcoma diagnosis.
        It's left me disabled with a lot of nerve issues, so a lot of chronic pain too. Basically a bunch of bullshit. I came IMGs from my (just about) year of treatment in August '21, and since then I've been doing a lot of physical therapy and running from appointment to appointment. So I am currently unemployed and not in school; though not for a lack of wanting to :(. In all of the free time I have, there's a lot of hobbies and such I use to keep myself busy and feeling fulfilled. Making this site is a way to document all of my thoughts, ideas, interests, dreams, hobbies etc. etc. I hope you enjoy it here, in all of it's unfinished glory!!
        </p>    
          <p><em style='font-weight:600'>More importantly though...</em> There's a lot more to me than that! I love love love animals. I have 3 cats, my childhood dog, and a gecko. I love reading; especially epic/dark/high/fae fantasy books. Also anything mythology-related too. I'm an artist; <i>don't ask what medium because I can't just pick one!</i> Also I'm a huge hobby hoarder; I love to try new ones all of the time. I am always intrigued by all things weird, spooky, gothic, and macabre. <i>(The whimsigoth-type style has enraptured me since I was a small child).</i> Also I love humor and laughter, and it's definitely 'the best medicine', or whatever they say. ALSO; I can never decide what type of career I'd like when it comes time, BUT I am a huge science fan; I planned to go to school for chemistry before it all went awry. <br> I don't want to delve too far into my more serious beliefs. Life is stressful already, and this is my little world away from all of the bullshit. That being said, some of my core principles are that generalizing people is never a good thing, blaming individuals for systematic issues is fucking stupid, people are born good at heart <s>no matter how much I hate them</s>, greed is killing this world; which also includes power most of the time, the patriarchy is fucking stupid and fighting against it will also help men. I could keep going, but I wont. I know that humanity won't get to my idealist world in my lifetime, but I'd like to at least try. Most of all <strong>LIFE IS SHORT! and HOPE AND LOVE WILL ALWAYS PREVAIL!</strong> Also mother nature is my God. I love the earth I love you Gaia
