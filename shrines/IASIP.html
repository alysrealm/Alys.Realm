<h1>"The Gang Gets their own Shrine"</h1>
<h2>What is "Always Sunny in Philadelphia?</h2>
<p>Always Sunny is an American sitcom created by Rob McElhenney with Glenn Howerton. The show features 'The Gang', a.k.a. Mac, Charlie, Dennis, Dee, and eventually Frank; a group of friends who are so depraved and degenerate that they end up in the wackiest situations. They own a dive bar in South Philadelphia, called <span>Paddy's Pub</span>, but spend a majority of their time up to shenanigans, leaving their bar quite barren as far as customers go. </p>
