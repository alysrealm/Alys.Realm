                <h2>backstory</h2>
                <p>When I was younger, I watched <i>a lot</i> of Youtube. (Some of those channels WAY better than the others). I used to LOVE watching the quirky, rainbow-haired, nerdy girl Youtubers,, just do a whole bunch of things basically (<em>ummmm baking and crafts?!?! hello!!!</em>). <b>In specific;</b> I remember watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMqM8X4dHjI" target="_blank">IHasCupquake</a> unbox the unicornos. I was enthralled. I already had an obsession with small, colorful, and dorky blind-bag  animal toys <a href="/shrines/Unicornos/myfavtrinkets.jpg" target="_blank">(see: *lps colorfully cute/ mlp of the same year*)</a>, but those were no where NEAR as intricate as these, and wayyy more accesible to get at the dollar store. I wanted to get my hands on some, but they were pricey, and I was too shy/afraid to ask because it would either be seen as greedy or childish. <s>nooo a child? being a child?</s> So after going through all I had gone through later in my life, and revisiting the Unicornos of my tweens, I knew I wanted one. Buying and doing things for that inner weirdo/child/freak was something I partook in a lot after it all. I bought my first one (the peach tree), on my special trip to Las Vegas, in some massive candy store in the Venetian. I was hooked. In the same outing I bought The Mother (aka the huge plushie one.) My collection has steadily grown. After all, I deserve occasional treats after spending half a year fighting for my life everyday. (Also FiveBelow started carrying them so they were cheaper; AND there is one in a plaza that's en route to the hospitals with my major appointments. Optimal treat gathering time) </p>
