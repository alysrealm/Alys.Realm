    <h2>Pothos</h2>
    <p>I actually call this plant "the mother"; I have for a while too considering I once propagated it and gave it to others. I have no idea how the 'babies' in this situation are. I no longer talk to most of those people. Besides my grandmother! She is a great plant mother to a pot of only two long ass pothos vines with  leaves that are really big and happy. (As well as my other misfit plants that I neglected)</p>
    <p>If you'll notice, this plant isn't very long or bushy or anything. That is because it hasn't been taken very well care of over the past few years. My room was re-done, and we moved it to a different room as we did it. That mixed with my mobility issues made her this really "leggy" thing that was just holding on. So I cut those vines up, and put them all in this pot. I can take better care of it now. I think its actually really symbolic.. The plant was thriving before I got sick, but somehow it has managed to survive this whole time, even if it kinda sucked for a while. I think that's beautiful. She's beautiful. Here's to a thriving, bushy, lush pothos from another branch of The Mother in my future!</p>
<h2>Huge box of stickers</h2>
<p>I think this is probably pretty self explanatory. I absolutely love stickers. This collection goes back years. Into my late middle school ones actually. I would email companies and lie about needing stickers for some bullshit reason like my snow board or cooler or something. </p>
