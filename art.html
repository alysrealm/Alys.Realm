    <p><span class="highlight">Welcome to my little art and creation sanctuary. I've been waiting for you.</span> I've been an artist from a young age, and it's always something I've brought myself back to when I needed a break from the chaos. I've dabbled in probably just about any &amp; every method of creating you can think of -and if I haven't- I have at least thought long and hard about what I could do with all of them. Some favorites of mine would have to be painting, drawing (allegedly), crochet &amp; other fiber arts, collage, pyrography, and clay/sculpting.</p>
    <p>Besides my own creative endeavors, I also really truly believe in the healing powers of art. My 10 months in the hospital would have been sooo much worse if it weren't for the art therapy program. Something I can only hope to do in this strange life of mine is find some way to help others through art <img id='smiley'></p>
